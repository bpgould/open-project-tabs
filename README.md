# open-project-tabs

What's better than having 34 Stack Overflow tabs open trying to fix some arcane bug? Calling it a night and saving 34 tabs to your desktop or in a junked up bookmarks folder in Chrome.

What if your computer restarts and you lose that blog from 2004 on a personal website that actually had the solution?

Perhaps you want to share a resource with a colleague that you were using a few weeks ago and you don't want to grep your search history.

<code>open-project-tabs</code> is a small node.js util package that simplifies the issue with keeping a bunch of tabs associated with a repo/project.

# Installation and Usage

You can install the package by running <code>npm i @binarytreereversal/open-project-tabs</code>

Then you can save your tabs in a file named <code>tabs.txt</code>.
